        <h1>12/27/24 Update</h1>
        <p>1:17 AM - Dude today I used Simulink, Simscape, HTML, and Git to learn Simulink/SimScape while also documenting my progress on my website. I'm learning so much it's crazy. I also
            <br> read 10 pages of the CDPR book and took notes on that today. I also watched so many videos about Ion propulsion, and some videos about how it is being an engineer. There's still much to learn. But I'm doing a damn good job. 
            <br> I also ran 4 miles today. I'm literally on fire man. If you're reading this you can 100% do this stuff if I can. I am a completely normal guy, no superpowers or anything. Just boredom and a couple dreams.</p>
